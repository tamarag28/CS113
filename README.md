# **CS 113 - Introduction to Programming in Java**

### **Overview:** 
This repository contains homework assignments and projects completed for CS 113: Introduction to Programming in Java at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). 

### **Course Description:**
  This course is a comprehensive introduction to the Java programming language, writing and testing of
  programs. The course consists of three major parts. The first part teaches fundamental programming techniques
  that use primitive data types, variables, assignments expressions, operators and control statements. The second
  introduces object-oriented programming, methods, parameter passing, recursion and arrays. The third part
  delves deeper into object-oriented programming by exploring inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism, abstract
  classes and finally discussing exception handling.

### **Material Covered:**
  - Introduction to programming and Java programming language
  - Data and Expressions
 - Using Classes and Methods
 - Decisions and Loops
 - Arrays and File I/O
 - Objects-Oriented Programming
    - Object-Oriented Design
    - Defining Classes and creating Objects
    - Defining methods
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism
 - Recursion
 - Exceptions
 - Searching and Sorting Algorithms
 - Collections
  
### **Learning Outcomes:**
  Upon completing the course, the students will be expected to know and be able to use these elements to
  compute the solution to a problem:
   - Understand the concept of classes and objects
   - Design and implement own classes
   - Create and correctly use objects of different types
   - Devise a sequence of steps (algorithm) that correctly solves a given problem.
   - Write a program that implements the algorithm using:
      - A main set of java programming language elements (variables, syntax, keywords)
      - Data types (primitive and object data types including arrays)
      - Statements that perform input/output, control statements
      - Exception handling
   - Understand inheritance and polymorphism and correctly use to solve complex problems
   - Understand recursion and implement recursive methods
